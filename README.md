### Typing GUI for language learners on Windows, Mac and Linux

**Scribe-Desktop** is a language learning interface for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The Scribe GUI provides needed information as the user types and serves as a field for input commands. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence.

Scribe is fully open-source and does not collect usage data or ask for system access. Feature data is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and stored in-app, meaning Scribe is a highly responsive experience that does not require an internet connection.

The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [featured by](#featured-by) also being a good resource for learning more about Scribe.

# Supported Languages [`â‡§`](#contents)

Scribe's goal is functional, feature-rich language interfaces for all languages. Check [scribe_data/extract_transform](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/tree/main/src/scribe_data/extract_transform) for queries for currently supported languages and those that have substantial data on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/).

The following table shows the supported languages and the amount of data available for each on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/):

| Languages  |   Nouns | Verbs | Translations\* | Adjectivesâ€  | Prepositionsâ€¡ |
| :--------- | ------: | ----: | -------------: | ----------: | ------------: |
| French     |  16,233 | 1,501 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| German     |  28,745 | 3,381 |         67,652 |           - |           187 |
| Italian    |     847 |    73 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| Portuguese |   5,109 |   495 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| Russian    | 194,401 |    11 |         67,652 |           - |            12 |
| Spanish    |  20,987 | 3,717 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| Swedish    |  42,002 | 4,160 |         67,652 |           - |             - |

`*` Given the current **`beta`** status where words are machine translated.

`â€ ` Adjective-preposition support is in progress [(see iOS issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/86).

`â€¡` Only for languages for which preposition annotation is needed.

Updates to the above data can be done using [scribe_data/load/update_data.py](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/tree/main/src/scribe_data/load/update_data.py).

# Keyboard Features [`â‡§`](#contents)

Keyboard features are accessed via keyboard shortcuts or the `Scribe button` within the interface. If the button is pressed, the user is presented with three selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural` in the interface's language. These commands allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field followed by a space. The user can also navigate through the presented menus using the arrow keys and make selections with the `return` or `Enter` keys.

**Current features include:**

<a id="translation"></a>

### â€¢ Translation [`â‡§`](#contents)

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `return` or `Enter` keys are pressed.

As of now translations are not widely available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) [(see iOS issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/40). The current functionality is thus based on [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) machine translations of words queried from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The ultimate goal is for the translations and synonyms to all be directly queried.

<a id="verb-conjugation"></a>

### â€¢ Verb Conjugation [`â‡§`](#contents)

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

<a id="noun-plurals"></a>

### â€¢ Noun Plurals [`â‡§`](#contents)

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural into the text field when the `return` or `Enter` keys are pressed.

<a id="word-annotation"></a>

### â€¢ Word Annotation [`â‡§`](#contents)

Scribe further annotates words in the command bar to help users understand the context of what they're typing. Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a given word and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe button` while it is selected. The hope is that annotation will help a user remember grammar rules even when not using Scribe.

#### Nouns

Scribe annotates nouns in the command bar according to the following conventions:

- Feminine: colored red ðŸŸ¥ and marked with (F)
- Masculine: colored blue ðŸŸ¦ and marked with (M)
- Common: colored purple ðŸŸª and marked with (C)
- Neutral: colored green ðŸŸ© and marked with (N)
- Plural: colored orange ðŸŸ§ and marked with (PL)
- More than one: marked with all their forms

The above form abbreviations are translated into their equivalents in the keyboard's language.

#### Prepositions

Scribe also annotates the grammatical cases (accusative, dative, etc) of prepositions in the command bar if there is a relation in the given language.

<a id="language-practice"></a>

# Language Practice [`â‡§`](#contents)

A future feature of Scribe is language practice within the app itself. Scribe presents users with information that is directly relevant to their current struggles with a second language. This information can be saved in-app and used to create personalized lessons such as flashcards to reinforce the information that Scribe has provided.

<a id="contributing"></a>

### Data Edits

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) or contacting us in the [issues for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues) and we'll be happy to integrate them!
